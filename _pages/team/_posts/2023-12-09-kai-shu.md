I hold the position of Gladwin Development Chair Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science at the Illinois Institute of Technology, a role I've been in since Fall 2020. My research interests span machine learning, data mining, and social computing, with practical applications in areas such as disinformation, education, and healthcare. I earned my Ph.D. in Computer Science from Arizona State University in July 2020, under the mentorship of Professor Huan Liu.

I am the proud recipient of several prestigious awards including the 2023 Microsoft Accelerate Foundation Models Research Award, 2023 DARPA AI Forward Scholarship Award, 2023 AAAI New Faculty Highlights, 2023/2022 Cisco Faculty Research Awards, and was a finalist for the 2022 Meta Research Award. I also received the 2020 ASU Engineering Dean's Dissertation Award. I have had the opportunity to intern at Microsoft Research AI, Yahoo Research, and HP Labs.

My research endeavors have been generously supported by federal agencies such as the NSF, DARPA, IARPA, DHS, and DOE, as well as industrial collaborators like Cisco, Google, and Microsoft.
