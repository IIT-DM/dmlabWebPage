Greetings, I am Canyu Chen (陈灿宇), currently in my third year of a Computer Science Ph.D. program at the Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT), having joined in the Fall of 2021. I am privileged to be mentored by Prof. Kai Shu. Prior to my time at IIT, I completed my B.S. in Computer Science at the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences (UCAS) in 2020.

My research is primarily focused on the development of Safe and Responsible Large Language Models, with practical applications in the fields of Social Computing and Healthcare. I have initiated and am leading a project titled 'LLMs Meet Misinformation', which is aimed at tackling the issue of misinformation in the era of Large Language Models. I am always open to discussions and potential collaborations. Feel free to reach out to me via email at cchen151 AT hawk.iit.edu or on WeChat (ID: alexccychen).
