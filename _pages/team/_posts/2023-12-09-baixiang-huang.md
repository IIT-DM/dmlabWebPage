I am Baixiang Huang, currently pursuing my first year of Ph.D. in Computer Science at Illinois Tech. I am fortunate to be under the guidance of Professor Kai Shu. My research primarily revolves around data mining and machine learning, with a particular emphasis on authorship analysis and spatial-temporal forecasting.

When I am not engrossed in my research, I enjoy a variety of outdoor activities including hiking, diving, skiing, and mountaineering. I have a passion for running and swimming, and have recently ventured into the world of weightlifting. Iâ€™ve been an enthusiastic console player since my childhood, starting at the age of eight. Playing the piano brings me immense joy, and I continually strive to broaden my literary horizons by adding to my reading list.
