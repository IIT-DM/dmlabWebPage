I am currently in my second year of a Ph.D. program at the Illinois Institute of Technology, under the guidance of Dr. Kai Shu. I hold an M.S. degree in Computer Science from the University of Oregon, where I was advised by Dr. Thien Nguyen, and a B.S. degree in Computer Science from Purdue University, where I worked with Dr. Yung-Hsiang Lu.

My research is centered around the development of reliable AI systems, with a particular focus on improving their robustness and interpretability. I have a wide range of interests in fundamental research and interdisciplinary collaborations, particularly those driven by significant applications such as misinformation detection and social network analysis.
