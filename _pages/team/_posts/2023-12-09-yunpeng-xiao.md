Hello, I am Yunpeng Xiao (肖云鹏), currently in my first year of a Ph.D. program at the Illinois Institute of Technology, under the guidance of Prof. Kai Shu. Prior to joining IIT, I earned my M.S. degree in Computer Science from the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences and my B.S. degree in Applied Biosciences from Zhejiang University.

My research interests encompass Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), Social Computing, and The Ethics of Science. I find great joy in engaging in conversations with people to gather fresh ideas.
