Hello, I am Yueqing Liang (梁月清), but you can also refer to me as Luna. I am presently in my second year of a Ph.D. program in the Department of Computer Science at the Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT), having joined in Spring 2022. I am privileged to be mentored by Prof. Kai Shu. Prior to my time at IIT, I completed my M.S. in Big Data in Business at the University of Sydney (USYD) in 2020, and my B.E. in Telecommunications Engineering with Management from Queen Mary University of London (QMUL) in 2018.

My research interests span a wide range of topics in data mining and machine learning, including but not limited to fairness, Natural Language Processing (NLP), Large Language Models (LLMs), recommender systems, and transfer learning.
