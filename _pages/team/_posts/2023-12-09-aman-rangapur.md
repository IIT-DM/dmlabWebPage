With a steadfast commitment to excellence, I am an accomplished Image Processing Engineer, actively engaged in the open-source community. With a wealth of experience spanning two years, I continuously strive to surpass boundaries and achieve remarkable results. My proficiency in programming and analytical skills enables me to develop deployable, learning-enabled systems, even within resource-constrained environments.

Currently pursuing my graduate degree in Computer Science, I am deeply passionate about exploring the frontiers of knowledge in Computer Vision, Trust Worthy AI, and Natural Language Processing. Specifically, I am fascinated by the transformative potential of deep learning techniques in advancing natural language understanding and generation.

Driven by a desire to learn and collaborate, I am actively seeking opportunities to contribute to research projects, internships, or collaborations within the realm of deep learning. I am eager to connect with experts in the field and leverage their expertise to further expand my capabilities.

If you have an opportunity that aligns with my skills and ambitions, I would be delighted to discuss potential collaborations. Together, we can create groundbreaking solutions that redefine the boundaries of technology. Please do not hesitate to reach out.
