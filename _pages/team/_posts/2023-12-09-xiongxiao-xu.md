I am currently in my second year of a Ph.D. program in the Department of Computer Science at the Illinois Institute of Technology, having joined in Spring 2022. I am fortunate to be under the guidance of Dr. Kai Shu. I completed my B.S. degree in Computer Science at Chongqing University in 2020, where I was advised by Dr. Hong Xie.

My research primarily revolves around data mining and machine learning, with a particular emphasis on time-series forecasting and graph learning. These areas of interest find practical applications in High-Performance Computing (HPC) systems and anomaly detection.
