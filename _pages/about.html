        <p>At <strong>Data Mining Laboratory (DM-Lab)</strong>, we are a group of researchers from the Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT) in Chicago, IL. We explore new and innovative ways of data mining, which allows machines to intelligently process, comprehend, and interact with complex data from various domains.</p>
    
        <p>We aim to design and implement effective and practical solutions for data mining and its various applications, such as social computing, natural language processing, and machine learning. We have a special interest in AI for social good, addressing issues such as dis-/misinformation, privacy, security, and healthcare.
        </p>
    
        <p>We also strive to build reliable and trustworthy AI models that highlight interpretability, robustness, and fairness. We have expertise in learning with imperfect data, using techniques such as self-/weakly-supervised learning, meta-learning, and data augmentation.
        </p>
    
        <p>We collaborate with other labs and industries, and we welcome postdoctoral research fellows and prospective Master's and Ph.D. students to join our team.

            We are also passionate about representation learning, encompassing text/graph mining, multi-modality, and adversarial learning. Furthermore, we actively participate in the creation and evaluation of large foundation models, with a focus on factuality, reliability, and safety. Our eagerness to push the frontiers of machine learning and data mining drives our commitment to making a positive impact on both the field and society.
