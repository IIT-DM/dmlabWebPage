        <p>At <strong>Data Mining Laboratory (DM-Lab)</strong>, we are a group of researchers from the Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT) in Chicago, IL. We explore new and innovative ways of data mining, which allows machines to intelligently process, comprehend, and interact with complex data from various domains.</p>
    
        <p>We aim to design and implement effective and practical solutions for data mining and its various applications, such as social computing, natural language processing, and machine learning. We have a special interest in AI for social good, addressing issues such as dis-/misinformation, privacy, security, and healthcare.
        </p>
    
        <p>We also strive to build reliable and trustworthy AI models that highlight interpretability, robustness, and fairness. We have expertise in learning with imperfect data, using techniques such as self-/weakly-supervised learning, meta-learning, and data augmentation.
        </p>
    
        <p>We collaborate with other labs and industries, and we welcome postdoctoral research fellows and prospective Ph.D. students to join our team.

            We are also passionate about representation learning, including text/graph mining, multi-modal learning, and adversarial learning. Moreover, we are involved in the creation and evaluation of large foundation models, with an emphasis on factuality, reliability, and safety. We are eager to advance the frontiers of data mining and make a positive impact on the field and society.</p>
